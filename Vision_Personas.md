## Vision Statement
FOR students WHO work with poorly scanned PDFs or paper handouts, openHighlightCopyPaste is a desktop app THAT provides students with a means of accessing highlighted text as digital text and support features that improve students study/review with key notes. UNLIKE manually copying and pasting text from a document scanned with OCR, OUR product provides the ability to quickly and conveniently extract specific text from pdfs and images

## Personas
##### Charlie

##### Alex

##### James   
James, 44, has decided to take an evening class at his local community center to learn Spanish, which has been a lifelong goal of his. He hasnâ€™t taken any classes since he graduated with his Associate IT degree at 20, so being in a classroom again feels new. The teacher hands out weekly packets that include vocabulary lists, reading assignments, and writing assignments.  James likes to highlight the words he is struggling with to continue to review later, and reviews by looking through the entire packet.  He is interested in using openHighlightCopyPaste to easily scan these words and have them in a separate, digital, source to easily review.
