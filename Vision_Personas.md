## Vision Statement
FOR students WHO work with poorly scanned PDFs or paper handouts, openHighlightCopyPaste is a desktop app THAT provides students with a means of accessing highlighted text as digital text and support features that improve students study/review with key notes. UNLIKE manually copying and pasting text from a document scanned with OCR, OUR product provides the ability to quickly and conveniently extract specific text from pdfs and images

## Personas
#### Charlie
Charlie, 17, is a student leader in the high school marching band. They are the treasurer, and so they’re in charge of running the yearly fundraising ad campaign. A binder of business leads which includes names, telephone numbers, addresses, email addresses, and names of owners is given to them. They are tasked with digitizing these records for ease of access. This way, students will be able to sell more ads to more businesses, and thus raise more money for the band. Charlie sits down with the binder and a box of highlighter pens. They highlight the names of the businesses in green, the telephone numbers in yellow, and so on. They then scan the binder into openHighlightCopyPaste, which returns a separate list of text for every highlighter color. It is easy to copy and paste the list of information, as each list is returned in a separate text file. Charlie copies and pastes each list in to a spreadsheet, and their task is done.

#### Alex
Alex, 20,  is an international student from Spain. She is currently studying at Temple University. She is Biology major but due to the robustness of her major classes she needs a tool to store her high-lighted notes. This will help her review important topics and terminology. Besides being a student, Alex enjoys the outdoors and music. She likes talking in Spanish with her fam/friends.


#### James   
James, 44, has decided to take an evening class at his local community center to learn Spanish, which has been a lifelong goal of his. He hasn’t taken any classes since he graduated with his Associate IT degree at 20, so being in a classroom again feels new. The teacher hands out weekly packets that include vocabulary lists, reading assignments, and writing assignments.  James likes to highlight the words he is struggling with to continue to review later, and reviews by looking through the entire packet.  He is interested in using openHighlightCopyPaste to easily scan these words and have them in a separate, digital, source to easily review.
