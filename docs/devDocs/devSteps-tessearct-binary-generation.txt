What I did to get source on our repo
cloned commit ef3bf98cc199017ec8f4711b45b38f6526868be2 to my desktop, built from that, then copy and paste the macBuild folder to our repo

#TODO:
update documents reflecting what tessearct I built from
git lfs writing for devs

then did the following 

cd into the library
./autogen.sh
mkdir __sysNameHere__Build
cd __sysNameHere__Build
# Optionally add CXX=g++-8 to the configure command if you really want to use a different compiler.
../configure PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/opt/icu4c/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/opt/libarchive/lib/pkgconfig:/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig
make -j
# Optionally build and install training tools.
make training



THEN I kept running into the following error code:

Please make sure the TESSDATA_PREFIX environment variable is set to your "tessdata" directory. Failed loading language \'eng\' Tesseract couldn\'t load any languages! 
Could not initialize tesseract.')

So I downloaded this file: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/blob/main/eng.traineddata\
and put it in lib/tesseract/tessdata

Then within the code there is a line telling the python interpreter where to find the language data and also where to find the tesseract brianmccaffrey
